# ProcessScheduler

Program Scheduler â€” Data Structures & Algorithms (Java)

Evaluate the efficiency of process scheduling algorithms (e.g., FCFS, Round Robin, SJF) in terms of CPU utilization and waiting times.
Measure the impact of resource allocation techniques (e.g., priority-based, multi-level feedback) on overall system performance
Implement a visual representation of the scheduling queue and resource allocation status using Java Swing to aid in real-time monitoring and debugging.
Offer a user-friendly CLI (Command-Line Interface) for users to set process priorities and dynamically adjust resource allocations based on system demands.
